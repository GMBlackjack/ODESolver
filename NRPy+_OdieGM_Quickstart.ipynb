    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Welcome to the Ordinary Differential Equation Solver Quickstart notebook, wherin we will both showcase a program that solves Ordinary Differential Equations and instruct users on how to use it. This notebook is designed as a tutorial to get users right into using the program, as well as providing a playground for users to not only play around, but also code custom implementations easily should it be desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Ordinary Differential Equation Solver, affectionately known as \"Odie,\" takes a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with initial boundary conditions and solves it numerically. There are many ways to implement the code, but the primary method shown here produces a text file with the previously unknown functions' values at various sequential points. \n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed information about what Odie is and how it operates can be found in the [Full Documentation](NRPy+_OdieGM_Full_Documentation.ipynb) notebook. There are other notebooks as well; the [Examples](NRPy+_OdieGM_Examples.ipynb) notebook contains two examples of how to use Odie to solve problems, and the [Code Regeneration](NRPy+_OdieGM_Code_Regeneration.ipynb) notebook can produce Odie's C-files in case they are lost are changed in a way that can't be reversed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code can be run entirely in either this jupyter notebook or as C-files. The C-file version has five files, four of which are the code itself, and the fifth is an example implementation that should be able to handle most systems of ODEs given to it. This jupyter notebook recreates the code in the C-files in full, however, it does not split it up into five files but rather creates one large file to be run all at once. Each section is still clearly labeled, and the various tutorial sections will make it clear what goes where. \n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced parts of Odie's operation are not included in this Notebook, anything that exists \"under the hood\" is only gone over in the [Full Documentation](NRPy+_OdieGM_Full_Documentation.ipynb) notebook; most users won't need to know it anyway. \n",

    "#### In order to solve a problem, one must first know the problem exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the code and instruct potential users on how to use it, we first need to specify exactly what sorts of problems it can solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "Odie seeks to take a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and solve it. To be clear, an ODE is an equation relating a function and its derivatives together, with the requirement that all derivatives be taken with respect to a single variable. If multiple variable derivatives are involved, it becoems a Partial Differential Equation. While the program only solves systems of first-order ODEs, every higher-order ODE can be split up into a system of first-order ODEs, thus the program can solve any order ODE so long as the user splits it up into a system first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, our program can solve equations of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} = f(x,y(x)) ; \\text{ given } y(a)=b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where a system would be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d\\vec y(x)}{dx} = \\vec f(x,\\vec y(x)) ; \\text{ given } \\vec y(a)=\\vec b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each $\\vec f$ component is some algebraic function. Here, each vector quantity contains a number of components equal to the number of equations in the system. If there are four components in $\\vec f$, then there are four in $\\vec y$ and $\\vec b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to the system is to find what the functions in $\\vec y$ actually are. The given $\\vec y(a)=\\vec b$ are the boundary conditions for the problem. There needs to be one of these for each component in $\\vec y$. For this solver, we start at the point $a$ and increase it over time, treating $a$ as the start of an \"initial condition.\" If the user wanted to evolve backward from some point, the system would simply have to be flipped.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will restrict itself to Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth type solution methods, which take an initial condition and evolve it forward in \"time\" with various relational methods. The specifics of these methods can be found elsewhere ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)) (NOTE: the notebook may not be updated to include Adaptive Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods). \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that one value is used to calculate another value forward in \"time,\" and this new value can be used to find the next one, and so on and so forth. Since we start with an initial condition, we can always use such methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adams-Bashforth methods require multiple points in order to evaluate forward one step, but this can be solved by either using a Runge-Kutta method for the first few steps, or starting from the first order Adams-Bashforth method and increasing it over time. Both options are supported by Odie. "

    "#### Odie is our friend, but do we understand our friend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the code itself, lets first discuss how it operates. In the C-code, there are five different files: `nrpy_odiegm.h`, `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, and `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm.h` and `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` serve very similar purposes. `nrpy_odiegm.h` contians the definitions for all the struct \"objects\" used by Odie. It also contains all the butcher tables that come pre-installed with the program: 15 standard Runge-Kutta methods, 6 inherently adaptive Runge-Kutta methods, and a table that stores all 19 Adams-Bashforth methods in one. Details about all these methods, their orders, and validaitions can be found elsewhere in [NRPy+ docmentation](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb) (NOTE: link will need to be changed once in the nrpytutorial repository). `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` just contains function prototypes, separated from `nrpy_odiegm.h` for organization purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c` contains the functions prototyped in `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`. The functions in here are irrelevant as while they contain the bulk of Odie's code, they also generally aren't necessary for a new user to look into. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three files above are expected to never be touched by the user, always running in the background. This is not the case for `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, which contains the various functions the user is expected to define, including the system of ODEs. In theory, it is possible to run Odie without `nrpy_odiegm_user_method.cs`, but that will put a lot more weight on the user to come up with the exactly correct format of functions. This template makes things much simpler. It does not depend on anything in the previous three files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last file, `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`, is not actually part of the Odie program, but an example file provided that can handle almost any differential equation passed to it, and it is prepared in such a way that it can even evaluate basic hybrid methods. It is not the most efficient possible program, as it performs a lot of checks to tell what it's supposed to be doing at any given time, so if efficeincy is the name of the game the user should define a custom main. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through each of these files and build them up in turn, though code the user doesn't need to know about will be compiled without any explanation. It is not recommended to try and read the giant walls of red text inside the cells that define the code--the explanations outside the cells should be sufficient for use. "

    "Here's `diffy_Q_eval`, the function that defines the system of Ordinary Differential Equations. It takes in four argumetns: `x`, `y[]`, `dydx[]`, and `params`. The first two should be obvious: where to evaluate and values of the differential equations. `dydx[]` is an array that stores the derivatives of the system based on the definition within `diffy_Q_eval`. `params` is just a fancy way of refering to `constant_parameters`, and is only passed as a void pointer since that was what GSL expected and we could not change the format of the primary function's arguments and still be a drop-in replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing this `diffy_Q_eval` does is optional but common, it checks for exceptions and then sets the constants using `exception_handler` and `const_eval`. This is just to make sure that all the values are correct before being evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "After it has set the constants, it sets a new variable `rho`. This just copies the value of `rho` from within `const_parameters`, making it so we don't have to pass pointers in the upcoming math, and so it easier to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of differential equations itself always needs to take the same format: $y' = f(y)$. The derivatives are always on the left hand side, alone, represented by the various components of `dydx[]`. The right hand side has the bulk of the differential equations, which can be made from any combination of algebraic values. This relation can be extremely complicated and can rely on various constants, $x$, and any number of the components of `y[0].` Keep in mind that order matters, for `dydx[0]` corresponds to the derivative of `y[0]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific case here, we have four different differential equations. Many of them depend on many values of `y[]`, but others depend on none, just the constant `rho`. We also see some square roots of `y[0]` here, revealing why we needed `exception_handler` to make sure we were never passed a negative value. \n",

    "One might notice that we actually have two sets of four equations here held beind an `if...else` statement. This is because trying to evaluate the derivatives at $x=0$ hits a discontinuity, but it just so happens that the values of the derivatives approach known limits, so we can set them manually. An `if` statement can also be used to declare piecewise differential equations, as is sometimes desired in situations where function behavior changes suddenly over a specific domain. \n",

Those that are completely independent are `step`, which is just the declared step size, `current_position`, which is where we start, `size`, which is the max number of steps to take, `adans_bashforth_order`, which declears the order of an Adams-Bashforth (AB) method if one is used, `no_adaptive_step`, which toggles that adaptive timestep, `report_error_actual`, which toggles reporting of actual error if the known solution is provided, `reportErrorEstimates`, which toggles reporting of error estimates, `abssolute_error_limit`, which puts a limit on the absolute error, `relative_error_limit`, which puts a limit on the relative error, and `file_name`, which just tells the program what the title of the file it is to write to is. Every last one of these can be altered by the user. \n",

    "Note that even if a method is used that doesn't have the capacity to report actual errors or error estimates, the program will still print something out if the report values are set to `true`.
