# ODESolver
Working on an ODE Solver.

Working now! Not sure what else to put here...

It is best for anyone who wants to know how to use it to rely on the tutorial jupyter notebook,
`NRPy+_OdieGM_Tutorial.ipynb`. All the information you could possibly want to know is found there. 

If you just want to run the C-code on its own, `nrpy_odiegm_main.c` is the file you want to run. 
By default it solves the TOV equations with an adaptive fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. 

The OldFilesWithValidation folder just holds some depricated code that I might want to refer to since it has 
a feature the current code no longer needs, but still could be useful.
