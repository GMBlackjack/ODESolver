    "## Introduction:\n",
    "This Ordinary Differential Equation Solver, affectionately known as \"Odie,\" takes a single Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with a boundary condition and solves it Numerically, the result being a text file with the previously unknown function's values. The code is generic and can use any Runge Kutta-style method to solve the ODE. That said, the methods currently have to be inserted manually in a format known as a \"butcher table.\" The following methods are included by default: the first-order Euler's Method, Runge Kutta 2 for second-order, Runge Kutta 3 (strong stability preserving, or SSPRK3) for third-order, Runge Kutta 4 (the standard one) for fourth-order, and Runge Kutta 5 (Cash-Karp version) for fifth-order. In addition, the program supports an internal validation check which checks the order of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this program does solve ODEs, it currently assumes that the ODE it is solving is already known and continually compares its results to the truth to check for error. For an unknown result, the code would have to be altered slightly to not continually calculate errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the very beginnings of the code. It will be expanded to systems of ODEs and gain variable time-step functionality eventually. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user cannot specify anything on runtime. If the function, solution method, step size, or boundary condition needs to be changed it must be done manually. \n",

    "#### In order to solve a problem, one must first know the problem exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program seeks to take an Ordinary Differential Equation and solve it. To be clear, an Ordinary Differential Equation is an equation relating a function and its derivatives together, with the requirement that all derivatives be taken with respect to a single variable. If multiple variable derivatives are involved, it becoems a Partial Differential Equation. Currently, this program is also limited to only handling first-order Ordinary Differential Equations with only first derivatives in it, though this will later be expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, our solver can solve equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} = f(x,y(x)) ; \\text{ given } y(a)=b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where f is some function that does not contain any derivative or integral operators. A solution is to find what the function y(x) actually is. The given y(a)=b is the boundary condition for this problem. For this solver we start at the point a and increase it over time, treating it as an \"initial condition.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will restrict itself to Runge-Kutta type solution methods, which take an initial condition and evolve it forward in \"time\" with various relational methods, all of which are based in the Taylor Series Expansion. The specifics of these methods can be found elsewhere ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)). The basic idea is that one value is used to calculate another value forward in \"time,\" and this new value can be used to find the next one, and so on and so forth. Since we start with an initial condition, we can always use such methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of note: the problem can be solved with no information as to what y actually is. However, since this program is currently in its early stages, we are only using simple equations will very well known answers, so we make use of this and continuously compare the program's calculated result with the real one to see how our errors behave.

    "#### A program is worse than useless if it doesn't work and you don't know it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of simulation codes is validation--does the program do what we expect it to do when presented with known data? Since we have the solutions to the simple equations we are testing already present, we have an opportunity to see not only if our estimations are accurate, but also if the error terms behave as expected. Every method we use has an associated \"error term\" with it, $\\mathcal{O}(h^m)$ where m is some integer that indicates the order of the error term. A first-order method would have m=2 since the method accurately represents terms up to m=1, and then the error is m=2. In words, a method of a certain order gets everything right up to that order, but not beyond it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, we are concerned with the error with respect to the step size, which is how far in \"time\" we evolve the solution with every calculation. The question is, how exactly do we determine the order of a method from the data alone? If the order of error matches what we expect, we consider the method validated. \n",

    "This method is very convenient for a few reasons. For one, it doesn't require any Taylor Series terms or any inputs aside from the first error terms of two separate calculations. In addition, the errors should be taken from the *first* step which means it isn't necessary to perform the calculations for the entire ODE twice just to get an order estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does have a rather major failing though, and that comes with its primary assumption: that the errors are dominated by a single term. This need not be the case and often changes based on the step size. The other higher-order error terms do influence the result, and they can do it in unexpected ways, and as such the result \"m\" will rarely, if ever, actually be an integer. However, as we know it should be an integer, if we round all the problems from the other terms will usually go away, though not always. Fortuantely, as this validation is largely for the method itself and not the answer, it's always possible to just insert a different more well-behaved function for validation. We use one of these funcitons in the below code to make everything neat. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a quirk that occurs if the Taylor Series Expansion of a solution is missing terms (or is finite). Say, for instance, the m=3 term was missing and we had an order 2 solver. Well, the order detector expects to find m=3, but instead it finds m=4 since there isn't any m=3 error term to find. This is not a problem, it is perfectly fine for a method to have an order *higher* than expected. Lower is when there would be a problem. Similar issues occur if the soluiton is exact or near exact, in which case the validation will claim the error order is infinite. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before looking at the code itself, lets first discuss how it operates. Before running the code, it is important that the user manually set certain things in the code itself. Within the funciton `diffyQEval` lies the definition of the differential equation itself. For this notebook, we have y' = y + 1 as our declaration, written as `return y+1.0;`. Any funciton of y and x can be placed here, as the funciton is passed x and y variables when called. In this case the passed x variable does nothing, but the functionality exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `knownQEval` we have the known solution. In this case it is $e^x-1$ represented by `return exp(x)-1.0;`. This is not strictly needed, as the program can find the solution on its own, but as we are very concerned with errors we want a truth to continually check against. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary condition needs to be declared as well. The variables for them are in the main function, with `bound` being the location of the boundary, and `bValue` being the value *at* that point. It's best to think of x as being `bound` and y as being `bValue`. For our ODE both of these are set to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there are a set of mutable parameters that determine how the simulation is run. `step` is the step size, which we have set to 0.01 for these tests. Smaller numbers mean better accuracy here. `SIZE` is how large the area we're solving for is. We start at `bound` but `SIZE` determines where we end. Normally this number should be quite large, but we have it set to 10 so we can print out all the results for this notebook. Lastly, there is a boolean variable `validate` which should be set to true if validation is desired, and false if not. We naturally have it set to true here. \n",
    "\n",
    "On runtime, the user is not given a chance to specify these numbers, as they are coded in. Currently this is the same for the five methods coded in by default: Euler, RK2, RK3, RK4, and RK5. These methods are in the program in the form of arrays called Butcher Tables, which the program converts into the actual calculation steps on runtime. Any theoretical Buther Table could be used, though naturally inserting nonsense will produce nonsense. The RK4 method is one commmonly used across multiple other solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the method is chosen, the code activates, sets up a timer to let the user know how many seconds the operation took, and opens a file to write all the output to. After that it executes the chosen method, the specifics of which we shall not go into since they are described elsewhere ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)). What should be noted is that on the first step, if `validation` is set to true, the code will attempt to evaluate the order of the error. It will always spit out something (even if that something is N/A or infinity), but it also checks to see if the error is currently within roundoff error (about 1e-14) for double precision variables. If it determines that it is within that error, it will attempt to calculate the order of the error again next step. Once it is past this, however, it will stop calculating and let the code run without any more validation. This is most helpful for calculations that start out *very* accurate but over time drift away. That said, this will compound the error in the order calculation itself, so the longer it takes for the system to reach a point outside of roundoff error the less the number should be trusted. We are unsure of precisely how much. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the calculation complete, the program closes the file it was writing to, `oData.txt`, reports the time taken in seconds, and ends. It makes sure to add commas so the output can also be read as a .csv, which is useful for analysis with Python, which we will do at the end of this notebook. "
