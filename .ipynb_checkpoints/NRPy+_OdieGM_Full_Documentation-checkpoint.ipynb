    "# Ordinary Differential Equation Solver \"Odie:\" Full Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authors: Gabriel M Steward\n",
    "\n",
    "### May 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Welcome to the Ordinary Differential Equation Solver Full Documentation notebook, wherin we will describe almost every facet of a code that solves systems of Ordinary Differential Equaitons. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Ordinary Differential Equation Solver, affectionately known as \"Odie,\" takes a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with initial boundary conditions and solves it numerically. There are many ways to implement the code, but the primary method shown here produces a text file with the previously unknown functions' values at various sequential points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code is generic and can use any Runge-Kutta-style method to solve the ODE, as well as Adams-Bashforth methods up to 19th order. There are a wide variety of methods pre-programmed into Odie, including some inherently adaptive Runge-Kutta methods up to eighth order, but if a user is able to provide a butcher table for a custom method the program can take that as well, though it would have to be inserted manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Runge-Kutta type methods can be run with adaptive timestep, where the program attempts to estimate the error and, comparing that with a user-set error tolerance, determines how far it should step forward. This is not available for Adams-Bashforth methods. All methods, including the inherently adaptive ones, can be run with a fixed time step option as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the way the program is segmented, it is possible to switch from adaptive to nonadaptive and from Runge-Kutta to Adams-Bashforth at will, depending on the user's desires. Switching methods is possible between every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odie was designed with the intent of being a replcement for GSL's Ordinary Differential Equations solver as it is used in lalsuite, and as such the formatting for many of the functions is similar if not the same as GSL. However, the internal workings of Odie are quite different from GSL, even if in most cases the result is identical or nearly identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is one of four for Odie, and is by far the most involved one. It explains everything about the code from the ground up. It is not recommended that first-time users start out here, instead they should rely on the [Quickstart](NRPy+_OdieGM_Quickstart.ipynb) and [Examples](NRPy+_OdieGM_Examples.ipynb) notebooks. [Quickstart](NRPy+_OdieGM_Quickstart.ipynb) is formatted as a tutorial to users who might know nothing, while [Examples](NRPy+_OdieGM_Examples.ipynb) show the code in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "Odie can be run entirely in either this jupyter notebook or as C-files. The C-file version has five files, four of which are the code itself, and the fifth is an example implementation that should be able to handle most systems of ODEs given to it. Every notebook recreate sthe code in the C-files in full, however, it does not split it up into five files but rather creates one large file to be run all at once. Each section is still clearly labeled, and the various sections will make it clear what goes where. The [Code Regeneration](NRPy+_OdieGM_Code_Regeneration.ipynb) notebook recreates the C-files in full in case the files are ever lost. \n",

    "#### In order to solve a problem, one must first know the problem exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the code and instruct potential users on how to use it, we first need to specify exactly what sorts of problems it can solve. (This section is redundant with the [Quickstart](NRPy+_OdieGM_Quickstart.ipynb) notebook but is kept here for completeness.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Odie seeks to take a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and solve it. To be clear, an ODE is an equation relating a function and its derivatives together, with the requirement that all derivatives be taken with respect to a single variable. If multiple variable derivatives are involved, it becoems a Partial Differential Equation. While the program only solves systems of first-order ODEs, every higher-order ODE can be split up into a system of first-order ODEs, thus the program can solve any order ODE so long as the user splits it up into a system first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, our program can solve equations of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} = f(x,y(x)) ; \\text{ given } y(a)=b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where a system would be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d\\vec y(x)}{dx} = \\vec f(x,\\vec y(x)) ; \\text{ given } \\vec y(a)=\\vec b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each $\\vec f$ component is some algebraic function. Here, each vector quantity contains a number of components equal to the number of equations in the system. If there are four components in $\\vec f$, then there are four in $\\vec y$ and $\\vec b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to the system is to find what the functions in $\\vec y$ actually are. The given $\\vec y(a)=\\vec b$ are the boundary conditions for the problem. There needs to be one of these for each component in $\\vec y$. For this solver, we start at the point $a$ and increase it over time, treating $a$ as the start of an \"initial condition.\" If the user wanted to evolve backward from some point, the system would simply have to be flipped. (Carefully, though, it's easy to get tripped up on what signs change and which one's don't.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will restrict itself to Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth type solution methods, which take an initial condition and evolve it forward in \"time\" with various relational methods. The specifics of these methods can be found elsewhere ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)) (NOTE: Link will need to be updated when this notebook is inside nrpytutorial). \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that one value is used to calculate another value forward in \"time,\" and this new value can be used to find the next one, and so on and so forth. Since we start with an initial condition, we can always use such methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adams-Bashforth methods require multiple points in order to evaluate forward one step, but this can be solved by either using a Runge-Kutta method for the first few steps, or starting from the first order Adams-Bashforth method and increasing it over time. Both options are supported by Odie. "

    "#### Odie is our friend, but do we understand our friend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the code itself, lets first discuss how it operates. In the C-code, there are five different files: `nrpy_odiegm.h`, `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, and `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm.h` and `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` serve very similar purposes. `nrpy_odiegm.h` contians the definitions for all the struct \"objects\" used by Odie. It also contains all the butcher tables that come pre-installed with the program: 15 standard Runge-Kutta methods, 6 inherently adaptive Runge-Kutta methods, and a table that stores all 19 Adams-Bashforth methods in one. Details about all these methods, their orders, and validaitions can be found elsewhere in [NRPy+ docmentation](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb) (NOTE: this link will need to be adjusted when this notebook is placed in nrpytutorial). `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` just contains function prototypes, separated from `nrpy_odiegm.h` for organization purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c` contains the functions prototyped in `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`. The functions in here are split into three types: allocation functions, freeing functions, and application functions. Allocation functions create the structs defined in `nrpy_odiegm.h` and fill them with proper values, managing memory if required. Freeing functions free the structs manually so there are no memory leaks. The majority of Odie is contained within the application functions. More precisely, one of them, `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply`, the function that all the other application functions call at some point. What this function ultimately does is \"integrate\" the solution of a given system of ODEs forward one step, the result being a new set of values at some subsequent point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three files above are expected to never be touched by the user, always running in the background. This is not the case for `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, which contains the various functions the user is expected to define, including the system of ODEs. In theory, it is possible to run Odie without `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, but that will put a lot more weight on the user to come up with the exactly correct format of functions. This template makes things much simpler. It does not depend on anything in the previous three files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last file, `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`, is not actually part of the Odie program, but an example file provided that can handle almost any differential equation passed to it, and it is prepared in such a way that it can even evaluate basic hybrid methods. It is not the most efficient possible program, as it performs a lot of checks to tell what it's supposed to be doing at any given time, so if efficeincy is the name of the game the user should define a custom main. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through each of these files and build them up in turn. However, much of this information is not necessary to know for day-to-day operation of the code, so we highly recommend users start with the [Quickstart](NRPy+_OdieGM_Quickstart.ipynb) and [Examples](NRPy+_OdieGM_Examples.ipynb) notebooks and refer back to this one as needed."

    "\n",
    "Many of `control`'s parameters are error related and not generally something the user will mess with, but here they are anyway. `abs_lim` is an imposed limit on the estimated absolute error, `rel_lim` is the same except for the estimated relative error. `scale_factor` is a number that is used to compare various errors, and `error_safety` is a factor that limits how drastically things can change at once to keep results stable. `ay_errror_scaler` determines how much of the estimated relative error is weighted toward the functions themselves, while `ady_error_scaler` places weight on the derivative. The next four parameters, `max_step_adjustment`, `min_step_adjustment`, `absolute_max_step`, and `absolute_min_step` all put limits on how much the step size can change. The first two put limits on how far the step can be adjusted when taking one step, while the latter two put global maximums and minimums. Lastly, we have `upper_error_tolerance` and `lower_error_tolerance`. These two tell the program how big or small the error has to be in order to trigger adaptive stepsize—if neither is triggered, the program pushes forward without changing the step size. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inner workings of the `control` struct is based on GSL's implemetnations of error, albeit with more options for freedom. It may be more illuminating to write out what's going on mathematically. First, we calculate a desired error. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\text{absLim} + \\text{relLim} * (\\text{ayErrorScaler}|y| + \\text{adyErrorScaler}|y'|) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where y and y' are our current proposed points after taking a step. The $D$ we calculate is a \"desired error.\" In the case where there are multiple equations in the system of ODEs, a $D$ is calculated for each one. Note that absLim and relLim add together, so if both absolute and relative errors contribute a lot to our error, the overall $D$ result will be higher. We also create an estimated error based on the behavior of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = |y_1 - y_2| * \\text{errorSafety} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are just two different guesses, one of which is the y used in calculating D. This seems primitive but by examining the difference we can estimate how much error occurs in general, with the `error_safety` term being able to make up for our uncertainty. GSL sets `error_safety` to 4/15 by default, so that's what we do as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we analyze the ratio $E/D$ for each equation in the system of ODEs, picking the largest one. If it is greater than `upper_error_toleranece` we go on to decrease the step size. If it is lower than `lower_error_tolerance` we go on to increase it. If it is in between them, we do neither. Note that if Odie increases a step size, it will still step forward with the smaller step since smaller steps are more accurate. It already calculated those values, why throw them out? It only throws out values if it is going to make them more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual adjustment formulae are as follows, with q being the order of the method being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{smaller} = h_{old} * \\text{scaleFactor} * (E/D)^{-1/q} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{bigger} = h_{old} * \\text{scaleFactor} * (E/D)^{-1/(q+1)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scale_factor` is 0.9 by default in GSL, and so it is here. \n",
    "\n",
    "`evolve` is the struct that \"evolves\" or \"extrapolates\" the System of ODEs and stores the values found for the next iteration. It also stores estimated errors to pass to `control` or to let the user report them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, `evolve` contains `*y0`, which is the actual solution calculated for the next step. It also has `*yerr` which holds the estimated errors. `last_step` is a paraemter rarely used but which can be helpful in making sure an sequence of steps stops a a very specific value and lets the user know that it's ready to stop early. `bound` and `current_position` are two very helpful numbers that record where the first step started and where the stepper currently is, respectively. `count` just keeps track of how many steps have been performed, while `no_adaptive_step` is a toggle that allows the adaptive timesteppers to be turned on or off at will. If `true`, the same step size will be taken every time. "

    "There are four allocation methods, one for `step`, `control`, `evolve`, and `driver`. These methods create the structs in their names, assign default values to most of their members, and allocate the proper amount of memory for the various arrays within. Note that `driver`'s allocation method calls all the others, so in an actual program the user likely only needs to use `nrpy_odiegm_driver_alloc_y_new`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we will look at it a little closer. `nrpy_odiegm_driver_alloc_y_new` takes in five arguments, a `nrpy_odiegm_system` a `nrpy_odiegm_step_type`, `hstart`, `epsabs`, and `epsrel`. The last two are the easiest to explain, they are the absolute and relative error limits, respectively. They are only used if the stepper method in use is adaptive, otherwise they do nothing—an argument still needs to be passed to them, though. `hstart` is the size of the initial step. \n",

    "\n",
    "All of these can be changed after `driver` is created, though the user will have to track down which variables need changing, and in general there would be no need to adjust the `system` unelss the same `driver` was being re-used to solve an entirely new system of equations. Changing `step_type` would require interfacing with the `step` struct and making sure all its parameters were set to identify the new `step_type` properly. This could either be done by manually setting values or just declaring a new `step` struct, allocating it, and replacing the `step` inside `driver` with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "`epsabs` and `epsrel` are stored within `control` and can be changed directly from there. `hstart` is likely to be rewritten rather quickly as the differential equaiton is solved for adaptive methods, but it will be stored in `driver`'s `h` member until then."

    "This beautiful beast is `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply`. What it does is, on the surface, very simple: it steps forward the solution exactly once; updating the result and any estimated errors that might be relevant. The complexity is that it is able to do this for any system of ODEs for any provided RK or AB method at any step. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply` takes 8 arguments. The first four are an `evolve`, a `control`, a `step`, and a `system` struct. If `driver` was allocated directly all four of these things should already be within `driver`, though ultimately the `system` will source its definition from `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c` as it contains the actual system of ODEs that needs to be solved. The other four are numbers: `*t` is where we start from, `t1` is where we wish to end, `*h` is the step size, and `y[]` is where we put the answer. Most often `y[]` will also just be contianed within `driver`, specifically inside `evolve`. Keep in mind, this method only evolves once, so `t1` is only important if we're near the edge of a solution. The only time `t1` is used the entire function is at the beginning to see if the step size needs to be shrunk so we don't overshoot `t1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inner workings of `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply` aren't particuarly important, it involves a lot of checks to determine exactly what kind of method is being passed to it, if it needs to remember results from previous iterations, and other such things. What is important is what is changed once it completes, for the function itself does not *return* anything but a placeholder \"0\", what it does is change things within arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `y[]` passed to it will contain the results. It will also copy this information into the `evolve` struct's `y0` just in case. `evolve` will also retain the estimated errors in `yerr`, if such errors were calculated. If the method needs to know the results of past calculations, Odie will store as much as many past steps as necessary in `step`'s `y_values` array. Odie will always increase `evolve`'s `count` variable by 1. The pased `*h` and `*t` variables will be changed as well, `*h` to the new step size (if it was adjusted) and `*t` to the new location after the step completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this the function will likely be called again and it will perform an all-new step. In between steps is usualy when the printing of the results takes place, if that's something the user wants to do. "

The first two should be obvious: where to evaluate and values of the differential equations. `dydx[]` is an array that stores the derivatives of the system based on the definition within `diffy_Q_eval`. `params` is just a fancy way of refering to `constant_parameters`, and is only passed as a void pointer since that was what GSL expected and we could not change the format of the primary function's arguments and still be a drop-in replacement. \n",

    "The set of differential equations itself always needs to take the same format: $y' = f(y)$. The derivatives are always on the left hand side, alone, represented by the various components of `dydx[]`. The right hand side has the bulk of the differential equations, which can be made from any combination of algebraic values. This relation can be extremely complicated and can rely on various constants, $x$, and any number of the components of `y[0].` Keep in mind that order matters, for `dydx[0]` corresponds to the derivative of `y[0]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific case here, we have four different differential equations. Many of them depend on many values of `y[]`, but others depend on none, just the constant `rho`. We also see some square roots of `y[0]` here, revealing why we needed `exception_handler` to make sure we were never passed a negative value. \n",

An `if` statement can also be used to declare piecewise differential equations, as is sometimes desired in situations where function behavior changes suddenly over a specific domain. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous sections we outlined Odie as a general Ordinary Differential Equation solver, explained and compiled all of its code, and went in-depth about everything a user would want to know and beyond. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question remains, what now? Well, a user with a specific application in mind could use the [Quickstart](NRPy+_OdieGM_Quickstart.ipynb) notebook's template to run whatever system of ODEs that needs to be solved. However, in the case of a more complex and invovled situation, it is recommended to run the code in C directly. Examples of what kinds of programs to run can be found in the aptly titled [Examples](NRPy+_OdieGM_Examples.ipynb) notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users are completely free to edit the code however desired. Even the header file and the functions usually kept from the user—there is nothing preventing adjustments. That said, the intent of Odie is to make it simple for users to solve ODEs of any sort; just because the option exists to edit everything doesn't mean it should be taken. Just put the differential equations into `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c` and run the main function with whatever settings are desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an extremely involved application of Odie, some of the program's structure will likely need to be fundamentally altered. Fortunately we also have an example of this, though not in jupyter notebook format. Odie's personal repository at https://github.com/GMBlackjack/ODESolver has a folder called TOVOdieGM. This contains a version of Odie specifically designed to solve the TOV Equations in complete generality in the Einstein Toolkit environment. Many fundamental things were changed to make this work seamlessly with the rest of the programs in the Toolkit, and it is not considered an example to follow as a template, but merely a proof of concept that the code can be adapted to even highly specific and restrictive situations and structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know the limitations of the code, such as roundoff error, or the higher-order Adams-Bashforth methods breaking down. Alongside this, it is also important to experiment. It is often impossible to predict which method will be the best for any given problem, so users should try several options. Higher-order methods can get out of control easily, adaptive timestep might lower the accuracy too much, or a badly behaved function might fool the default settings on the error analysis and the error limits will need to be adjusted to compensate. The results can often be surprising, so it is best to fine-tune any algorithms used, and not just trust the first result Odie reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we wish any potential users good luck, hopefully this notebook contains all needed resources to both use and adjust the code whenever and however it needs to be.\n",
