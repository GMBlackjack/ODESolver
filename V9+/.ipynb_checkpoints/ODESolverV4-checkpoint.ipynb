    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Welcome to the Ordinary Differential Equation Solver Tutorial notebook, wherin we will both showcase a program that solves Ordinary Differential Equations and instruct users on how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Ordinary Differential Equation Solver, affectionately known as \"Odie,\" takes a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with initial boundary conditions and solves it numerically. There are many ways to implement the code, but the primary method shown here produces a text file with the previously unknopwn functions' values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code is generic and can use any Runge-Kutta-style method to solve the ODE, as well as Adams-Bashforth methods up to 19th order. There are a wide variety of methods pre-programmed into Odie, including some inherently adaptive Runge-Kutta methods, but if a user is able to provide a butcher table for a custom method the program can take that as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Runge-Kutta type methods can be run with adaptive timestep, where the program attempts to estimate the error and determine how far it can step and still maintain a user-set error tolerance. This is not available for Adams-Bashforth methods. All methods, including the inherently adaptive ones, can be run with a fixed time step option as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the way the program is segmented, it is possible to switch from adaptive to nonadaptive and from Runge-Kutta to Adams-Bashforth at will, depending on the user's desires. Switching methods is possible between every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odie was designed with the intent of being a replcement for GSL's Ordinary Differential Equations solver in lalsuite, and as such the formatting for many of the functions is similar if not identical to GSL. However, the internal workings of ODIE are quite different from GSL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code can be run entirely in either this jupyter notebook or as C-files. The C-file version has five files, four of which are the code itself, and the fifth is an example implementation that should be able to handle most systems of ODEs given to it. This jupyter notebook recreates the code in the C-files in full, however it does not split it up into five files but rather creates one large file to be run all at once. Each section is still clearly labeled, however, and the tutorial below will make it clear what goes where. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the user has no need for a tutorial and just wants to run the code, there is a section near the bottom of this notebook designed explicitly for user input, the Customization section ([Step 5a](#S5a) below). Here, the user can specify essentially everything ranging from the system of ODEs, to the termination condition, to the method type, to highly specific manipulation of error limiting parameters. In most cases this will involve directly modifying C-code, so reading the tutorial first is highly recommended. \n",

    "Odie seeks to take a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and solve it. To be clear, an ODE is an equation relating a function and its derivatives together, with the requirement that all derivatives be taken with respect to a single variable. If multiple variable derivatives are involved, it becoems a Partial Differential Equation. While the program only solves systems of first-order ODEs, every higher-order ODE can be split up into a system of first-order ODEs, thus the program can solve any order ODE so long as the user splits it up into a system first, which is always possible for ODEs. \n",

    "$$ \\frac{dy_n(x)}{dx} = f(x,y_n(x)) ; \\text{ given } y_n(a)=b_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is some function that does not contain any derivative or integral operators. A solution is to find what the functions $y_n(x)$ actually are. The given $y_n(a)=b_n$ are the boundary conditions for the problem. For this solver we start at the point $a$ and increase it over time, treating $a$ as the start of an \"initial condition.\" If the user wanted to evolve backward from some point, the system would just have to be flipped, replacing in this notation the parameter $x$ with $-x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will restrict itself to Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth type solution methods, which take an initial condition and evolve it forward in \"time\" with various relational methods. The specifics of these methods can be found elsewhere ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)) (NOTE: the notebook may not be updated to include Adaptive Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods). \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that one value is used to calculate another value forward in \"time,\" and this new value can be used to find the next one, and so on and so forth. Since we start with an initial condition, we can always use such methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adams-Bashforth methods require multiple points in order to evaluate forward one step, but this can be solved by either using a Runge-Kutta method for the first few steps, or starting from the first order Adams-Bashforth method and increasing it over time. Both options are supported by Odie. "

    "#### Odie is our friend, but do we understand our friend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the code itself, lets first discuss how it operates. In the C-code, there are five different files: `nrpy_odiegm.h`, `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c`, `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods.c`, and `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm.h` and `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` serve very similar purposes. `nrpy_odiegm.h` contians the definitions for all the struct \"objects\" used by Odie. It also contains all the butcher tables that come pre-installed with the program: 15 standard Runge-Kutta methods, 6 adaptive Runge-Kutta methods, and a table that stores all 19 Adams-Bashforth methods in one. Details about all these methods, their orders, and validaitions can be found elsewhere. ([here](https://nbviewer.org/github/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb), once the push goes through) `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c` just contains function prototypes, separated from `nrpy_odiegm.h` for organization purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm_funcs.c` contains the functions prototyped in `nrpy_odiegm_proto.c`. The functions in here are split into three types: allocation functions, freeing functions, and application functions. Allocation functions create the structs defined in `nrpy_odiegm.h` and fill them with proper values, managing memory if required. Freeing functions free the structs manually so there are no memory leaks. The majority of Odie is contained within the application functions. More precisely, `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply()`, the function that all the other application functions call at some point. What this function ultimately does is \"evolve\" the solution of a given system of ODEs forward one step, the result being a new set of values at some later point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three files above are expected to never be touched by the user, always running in the background. This is not the case for `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods`, which contains the various functions the user is expected to define, including the system of ODEs. The majority of this tutorial will be concerned with how to properly edit and manage this file. In theory it is possible to run Odie without this file, but that will put a lot more weight on the user to come up with the exactly correct format of functions. This template will make things much simpler. It does not depend on anything in the previous three files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last file, `nrpy_odiegm_main.c`, is not actually part of the Odie program, but actually an example file provided that can handle almost any differential equation passed to it, and it is prepared in such a way that it can even evaluate hybrid methods. It is not the most efficient possible program, as it performs a lot of checks to tell what it's supposed to be doing at any given time, so if efficeincy is the name of the game the user should define their own main. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through each of these files and build them up in turn, though if a user just wants to know how to use Odie and not the inner workings of how the solver works, then it is recommended to skip past the headers and function declarations to the `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods` section, as that is where the user will most likely interface with the program. It is, however, important to run all the code in this notebook section (Step 2) every time, as it declares many things that will be used extensively later. "

    "These three structs, `step`, `control`, and `evolve` are the \"primary actors\" of Odie, as they actually do most of the heavy lifting. `step` is concerned with holding the `step_type` as well as managing what kind of steps should be taken, in addition to an array that can store past values between iterations in case those are needed, which they are for AB reasons. Its role is admittedly somewhat niche. \n",
    "\n",
    "`step` contains a `step_type` simply called `type` as well as `rows` and `columns` that are just repeated instances of the values in `step_type` to make things easy to access. `methodType` tells Odie if it's using an RK, Adaptive RK, or AB method at the moment. `adamsBashforthOrder` tells the program what kind of AB method it is using, while `yValues` is a mysteirous array used to store past values of points for AB methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that for all the structs, the user genreally doesn't have to define all the parameters directly, they will be filled automatically; they are merely here if the user *does* want to manipulate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "`control`, on the other hand, has a much more defined role in the program: it holds the values used for error analysis and adaptive timestep. `control` isn't even used in situations where adaptive timestep isn't taken, but when it is taken, the dozen or so values in here all allow for fine-tuning of how exactly the adaptive time step should be managed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of `control`'s parameters are error related and not generally something the user will mess with, but here they are anyway. `absLim` is an imposed limit on the estimated absolute error, `relLim` is the same except for the estimated relative error. `scaleFactor` is a number that is used to compare various errors, and `errorSafety` is a factor that limits how drastically things can change at once to keep results stable. `ayErrrorScaler` determines how much of the estimated relative error is weighted toward the functions themselves, while `adyErrorScaler` places weight on the derivative. The next four parameters, `maxStepAdjustment`, `minStepAdjustment`, `absoluteMaxStep`, and `absoluteMinStep` all put limits on how much the step size can change. The first two put limits on how far the step can be adjusted when taking one step, while the latter two put global maximums and minimums. Lastly, we have `upperErrorTolerance` abd `lowerErrorTolerance`. These two tell the program how big or small the error has to be in order to trigger adaptive stepsize--if neither is triggered, the program pushes forward without changing the step size. \n",
    "\n",
    "the math of the `control` struct is based on GSL's implemetnations of error, albeit with more options for freedom. It may be more illuminating to write out what's going on mathematically. First, we calculate a desired error. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = absLim + relLim * (ayErrorScaler|y| + adyErrorScaler|y'|) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where y and y' are our current proposed points after taking a step. The $D$ we calculate is a \"desired error.\" In the case where there are multiple equations in the system of ODEs, a D is calculated for each one. Note that absLim and relLim add together, so if both absolute and relative errors contribute a lot to our error, the overall D result will be higher. We also create an estimated error based on the behavior of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = |y_1 - y_2| * errorSafety $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are just two different guesses, one of which is the y used in calculating D. This seems primitive but by examining the difference we can estimate how much error occurs in general, with the `errorSafety` term being able to make up for our uncertainty. GSL sets `errorSafety` to 4/15 by default, so that's what we do as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we analyze the ratio E/D for each equation in the system of ODEs, picking the largest one. If it is greater than `upperErrorToleranece` we go on to increase the step size. If it is lower than `lowerErrorTolwerance` we go on to decrease it. If it is in between them, we do neither. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual adjustment formulae are as follows, with q being the order of the method being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{smaller} = h_{old} * scaleFactor * (E/D)^{-1/q} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{bigger} = h_{old} * scaleFactor * (E/D)^{-1/(q+1)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scaleFactor` is 0.9 by default in GSL, and so it is here. \n",
    "\n",
    "`evolve` is the struct that \"evolves\" or \"extrapolates\" the System of ODEs and stores the values found for the next iteration. It also stores estimated errors to pass to `control` or to let the user report them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it contains `*y0`, which is the actual solution calculated for the next step. It also has `*yerr` which holds the errors. `last_step` is a paraemter rarely used but which can be helpful in making sure an sequence of steps stops a a very specific value and lets the user know that it's ready to stop early. `bound` and `currentPosition` are two very helpful numbers that record where the first step started and where the stepper currently is, respectively. `count` just keeps track of how many steps have been eprformed, while `noAdaptiveTimestep` is a toggle that allows the adaptive timesteppers to be turned on or off at will. If `true`, the same step size will be taken every time. "

    "There are four allocation methods, one for `step`, `control`, `evolve`, and `driver`. These methods create the structs in their names, assign default values to all their members, and allocate the proper amount of memory for the various arrays within. Note that `driver`'s allocation method calls all the others, so in an actual program the user likely only needs to use `nrpy_odiegm_driver_alloc_y_new`. \n",

The last two are the easiest to explain, they are the absolute and relative error limits, respectively. They are only used if the stepper method in use is adaptive, otherwise they do nothing. `hstart` is the size of the initial step. \n",

That's all that needs to be provided to the `driver`. \n",

Changing `step_type` would require interfacing with the `step` object and making sure all its parameters were set to identify the new `step_type` properly. This could either be done by manually setting values or just declaring a new `step` struct, allocating it, and replacing the `step` inside `driver` with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "`epsabs` and `epsrel` are stored within `control` and can be changd directly from there. `hstart` is likely to be rewritten rather quickly as the differential equaiton is solved, but it will be stored in `driver`'s `h` member until then."

    "This beautiful beauty is `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply`. What it does is, on the surface, very simple: it steps forward the solution exactly once and reports the result and any estimated errors that might be relevant. The complexity is that it is able to do this for any system of ODEs for any provided RK or AB method at any step. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply` takes 8 arguments. The first four are an `evolve`, a `control`, a `step`, and a `system` struct. If a `driver` was allocated directly all four of these things should already be within the `driver`, though ultimately the `system` will source its definition from `nrpy_odiegm_user_methods` as it contains the actual system of ODEs that needs to be solved. The other four are numbers: `*t` is where we start from, `t1` is where we wish to end, `*h` is the step size, and `y[]` is where we put the answer. Most often `y[]` will also just be contianed within `driver`, specifically inside `evolve`. Keep in mind, this method only evolves once, so `t1` is actually only important if we're near the edge of a solution. The only time `t1` is used the entire function is at the beginning to see if the step size needs to be shrunk so we don't overshoot `t1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inner workings of the `nrpy_odiegm_evolve_apply` aren't particuarly important, it involves a lot of checks to determine exactly what kind of method is being passed to it, if it needs to remember results from previous iterations, and other such things. What is important is what is changed once it completes, for the function itself does not *return* anything but a placeholder \"0\", what it does is change thigns within arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `y[]` passed to it will contain the results. It will also copy this information into the `evolve` struct's `y0`. `evolve` will also retain the estimated errors in `yerr` if such errors were calculated. If it needs to know the results of past calculations, it will store as much as it needs in `step`'s `yValues` array. It will increase `evolve`'s `count` variable by 1. The pased `*h` and `*t` variables will be changed as well, `*h` to the new step size (if it was adjuste) and `*t` to the new location after the step completed. \n",

    "After this the function will likely be called again and it will perform an all-new step. In between steps is usualy when the printing of the resutls takes place, if that's something the user wants to do. "

    "The line with cirlces is u', while the one without is u itself. If the Euler method was used, as was set by default, we should see some clear divergence by the end of the procedure: the values start out nearly the same between calculated and exact but slowly diverge. Methods with orders that are much higher than Euler's will produce essentially no discernable difference between the two graphs, everything will look blue. Which is not to say the result is perfect, merely that the difference is not discernable at this scale.\n",

The program reports error in an exact sense: it can be positive or negative and indicates precisely how far off from the truth the result was.

    "This tells us a lot more than the simple error plot! First of all, assuming the parameters have not been adjusted by the user, we can see clearly that the error starts at around 1e-3 and grows to 1e-2. Naturally this is not very good, less than 2 sig figs of agreement at the end, but this is Euler's method, we know it's not very good, we specifically chose it so we could visually see features on the full scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we do note is that the errors for the function u are well behaved and don't do anything unusual, slowly growing as is to be expected. However, the errors for u' spike in the middle! Why is this? Well, if we look at how u' itself behaves in the first graph, that is where it crosses the x axis--that is, u'=0 at some point. As the values get closer to zero, they get smaller and smaller, and thus the relative error between said values increases markedly. We could not see this feature in the direct error plot, but here it's on full display! Being aware of points where functions go to zero is an important part of analyzing them properly, and spikes like this in the error can be used to find them. \n",

    "We note the very curious result that while the errors are different in magnitude, their shape is virtually identical. The fact that 0.02 has more error than 0.01 is expected: smaller step size leads to higher resolution. But it almost looks as though there is a relaiton between the two errors. That is because there is a relation, that relation is based on the order of the error itself. Adjusting the step size by a factor of two should introduce an error difference of ariybd $2^m$, where m is the order of the error. in this case, m is 4, so we should see error adjustments by a factor of 16. Do we? \n",

In genreal, the TOV equations represent a relativistic picture of a spherically symmetric star with respect to the radius. \n",

P is pressure, $\\nu$ doesn't correlate to something easily seen as physica, m is the total enclosed mass of the star, and r-bar is the isotropic radius (non-normalized). Though, really, as an example the physical meaning of the results are unimportant. \n",

    "With all this, we have 4 differential equations and 1 constant we wish to report. We also need to consider our boundary conditions. Traditionally, we start from the center of the star at r=0. This, naturally, will provide some issues as the solver will run into divide by zero errors if it tries to evaluate any point there. However, in our declaration we will demonstrate how to avoid this issue, as well as avoiding problems that will arise if, say, the pressure goes negative due to an estimation error and makes the energy density NaN, which breaks everything. It can all be handled in the program so long as it is implemented properly. \n",

    "The comb occurs when we have two sets of data that are reported at different resolutions but nonetheless represent the same quantity. As we can see, all four quantities we can compare demonstrate the comb effect. What's happening is that the NRPy+ TOV solver decided it didn't need to sample a lot of points in the middle of the star since it was behaving rather regularly, and so it takes steps of rougnly 0.01 in size, which we see here as the width of each segment of the comb. The points with the least error *are* the points NRPy+ TOV was reporting, which agree to 12 to 15 digits according to the exponent on the relative error. The \"hump\" errors are the errors of the cubic interpolation, which is not able to perfectly smooth out the data. However, even the places where the interpolator is the worst is still correct to 7 digits, barring the spike that occurs at the edge of the star due to some values drifting near to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind this does not necessarily mean our program is \"less accurate\" than the NRPy+ TOV solver. In fact, since we take so many small steps, we are likely more accurate. All we can say is that we are extremely close to what the NRPy+ TOV solver thinks the answer is near the points where the NRPy+ TOV solver was actually evaluating, which means the disagreement between them is minimal. It is impossible to reduce the disagreement to absolutely zero, since we use different stepping methods and have a slightly different (more general) implementaiton. \n",
